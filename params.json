Our approach discovers automatically the hierarchical structure of the architecture by using a specific tool (hwloc) that allows obtaining runtime\r\ninformation about the machine. \r\n\r\n##MultiBSP \r\nMulti-Bulk Synchronous Parallel (MultiBSP) is a recently proposed parallel programming model for multicore machines that extends the classic BSP model. MultiBSP is very useful to design algorithms and estimate their running time, which are hard to do in High Performance Computing applications. For a correct estimation of the\r\nrunning time, the main parameters of the MultiBSP model for different multicore architectures need to be determined. \r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
